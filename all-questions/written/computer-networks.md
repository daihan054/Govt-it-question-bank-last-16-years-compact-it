## Transport Layer (TCP & UDP) (19)
1. A client needs to send 4000\text{ bytes} of data to a database server. The client divides the data into packets of 500\text{ bytes} each. The sequence number of the first packet is 3001. After 2500\text{ bytes} have been successfully sent, 2 packets are lost/failed. Assuming TCP cumulative ACK, complete the following table: [BSCCPL AME 21-08-2026 (BUET)]

| SL | Client Packet Sequence No. | DB Server Sequence No. | ACK Sequence No. |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | | | |
| 2 | | | |
| 3 | | | |
| 4 | | | |
| 5 | | | |
| 6 | | | |
| 7 | | | |
| 8 | | | |

Assumption: The first 5 packets (2500\text{ bytes}) are sent successfully. Packets 6 and 7 are lost, while packet 8 arrives. The server sends a cumulative ACK for the next byte it is expecting. Find the missing values in the table.

“The acquisition of knowledge is one of the most essential things of life. Man is not only a being, he is a being with mind, conscience and intelligence. These faculties of his mind can be made to grow and develop only with patience and knowledge. Where the universe is concerned, knowledge means knowing man, nature and the universe and their relationship. Man is born ignorant of the knowledge of the world. But he can attain it through learning and education. If man is capable of it in the future, he must attain the truth from man himself. Will he use his power cleverly? Philosophy should make it known that the truth can be revealed only when the tyranny of prejudice and blind traditions is broken away. And if philosophy can help us feel the value of true things, then it can bring light into a world of darkness.” Questions: (2 \\times 5 = 10) (a) Why is the acquisition of knowledge essential? (b) How can knowledge grow? (c) Who is the being with mind, conscience and intelligence? (d) Where does the future danger to man come from?
